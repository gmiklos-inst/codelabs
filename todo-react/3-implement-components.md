# Implementing a component using BUC

Bridge ui has it's own unified component library, called BUC.

To check out components, see the Storybook online:

![Bridge UI Components](https://buc.inseng.net/?path=/story/bridge-ui-components--readme)

to install it,

```shell
$ npm i -S @inst/bridge-ui-components.icon
$ npm i -S @inst/bridge-ui-components.text-input
```

Now, let's add a `TextInput` to our application:

`app.js`
```javascript
import
```
