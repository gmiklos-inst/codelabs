# Setting up your Spring project

A great way to get started with a Spring boot application is by visiting the [https://start.spring.io/](Spring Initializr website) and choose the following options:
* Project: `Gradle Project`
* Language: `Kotlin`
* Spring Boot: `2.1.4`
* Group: `com.instructure.budapest`
* Artifact: `codelabs`
* Dependencies: `Web, JPA, PostgreSQL`

Click `Generate Project` and save/extract the downloaded zip file.

Now you have your base `SpringBootApplication` set up with all the required dependencies in your `build.gradle` file.
